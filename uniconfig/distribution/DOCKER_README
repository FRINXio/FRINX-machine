This is a placeholder folder, which can be left empty or contain a karaf distribution.

If there is a karaf distribution (files directly in this folder e.g. ./run_uniconfig.sh is here) it
will be used in the uniconfig docker container.

This folder can be used to upload a different distribution into uniconfig container.
