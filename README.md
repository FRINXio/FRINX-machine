# FRINX Machine

## Requirements
Hardware:
- 16GB RAM
- 4x CPU

You can deploy the FM either locally with all services running on a single node, or you can split UniFlow and UniConfig instances among multiple nodes. UniFlow is always running on the docker swarm manager node.

To deploy an FM swarm cluster you need at least one machine with Ubuntu 18.04 installed.

## Single-node deployment
Installation and running of UniFlow and UniConfig on the same machine.
### Installation
Run the install script, this will check and download the neccessary prerequisities:
```sh
$ sudo ./install.sh
```
Automatically installed software:
- curl
- docker-compose 1.22.0
- docker-ce 18.09

NOTE: It may happen that swarm initialization will fail during install. Most likely due to multiple network interfaces present. 
In that case run `docker swarm init --advertise-addr <ip-addr>` command to tell swarm which to use for 
inter-manager communication and overlay networking

NOTE: As FM is designed to run as non-root user, you need the user to be in `docker` group, this is done automatically during the installation process. Use newgrp or reboot the system for changes to take effect **BEFORE** running ```./startup.sh```
See: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user

### Startup
To deploy both UniFlow and UniConfig locally (for testing and demo purposes), run `startup.sh`:
```sh
$ ./startup.sh
```
The FRINX Machine services will now be started. 

To check the status of all services use
```sh
$ docker service ls
```

Each service will show as 'REPLICAS 1/1' when the service is up (it may take several minutes to start all services).

UniFlow dashboard is accessible via web browser by visiting:
```sh
https://<IP_of_node_running_FM>
```
In some cases the self signed certificate of the FM dashboard creates an NET_ERR_CERT_INVALID error message in your browser. Follow [these](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35274659/does-using-badidea-or-thisisunsafe-to-bypass-a-chrome-certificate-hsts-error) steps to proceed.

### Demo workflows & sample topology
Once all services are started, please clone https://github.com/FRINXio/fm-workflows and follow the instructions to load demo workflows and a sample topolgy. You can find a collection of demo use cases here https://docs.frinx.io/frinx-machine/use-cases/index.html

### Shutdown
To stop all services, simply remove the stack from the swarm:
```sh
$ docker stack rm fm
```
Where 'fm' (FRINX Machine) is the name of the swarm stack configured during deployment, the name is assigned automatically.

To remove all persistent data, purge the volumes (ATTENTION!!! ALL USER DATA WILL BE LOST):
```sh
$ docker volume prune
```

### Checking
You can check the status of the swarm cluster by running:
```sh
$ docker service ls
$ docker stack ps fm
```
Where 'fm' (FRINX Machine) is the name of the swarm stack configured during deployment, the name is assigned automatically.

### Log collections
To collect logs, run:
```sh
$ ./collectlogs.sh
```
This will collect all docker related logs and compresses it into an archive. Logs are collected from local machine only, if you want logs from remote node (e.g. worker) you must copy and run the script on the remote node.

## Multi-node deployment
UniFlow services are deployed on swarm manager node and UniConifig services are deployed on swarm worker node.

### Deploying UniFlow services
Run the installation on manager node as for Single-node deployment.

To only deploy UniFlow services on a manager node use `--uniflow-only` flag:
```sh
$ ./startup.sh --uniflow-only
```

It is possible to deploy UniFlow services without service "micros" (default UniConfig workers and workflows):
```sh
$ ./startup.sh --uniflow-only --no-micros
```

NOTE: Flag `--no-micros` can be also used in single-node deployment.

Run following command on manager node to determine the swarm token
```sh
$ docker swarm join-token worker
```

### Deploying UniConfig services
Install and set-up docker-ce on worker node:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install curl
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce=5:18.09.9~3-0~ubuntu-bionic
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
$ newgrp docker
```

And then join the worker node to the swarm with token provided by the manager:
```sh
$ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-<TOKEN> IP:PORT
```

To deploy UniConfig to a worker node, distribute the default UniConfig configuration to `/opt` directory on the worker node (SCP used as an example) and use `--deploy-uniconfig NODENAME` flag.

From the manager node:
```sh
$ scp -r ./config/uniconfig/frinx username@host:/home/username/
```
Log into remote node and copy the files:
```sh
$ sudo cp -r /home/username/frinx /opt
```
From the manager node, deploy uniconfig instance to a worker:
```sh
$ ./startup.sh --deploy-uniconfig NODENAME
```
NODENAME must be a valid docker swarm worker name, to get a list of current workers, issue `docker node ls`.
Each deployment creates a unique per-worker YAML file stored in folder `./uniconfig/composefiles/` which is then used for actual service deployment.

NOTE: The deployment might take a while as the worker node needs to download all neccessary images first.

## For developers
If you need to modify and rebuild modules, you can use `pullmodules.sh` script to download up-to-date modules from FRINX's public GitHub repositories. Then you can use standard docker utilities to build and distribute them, e.g.:
```sh
$ cd build/uniconfig
$ docker build .
```

### Building and distribution of custom images
In case you need to test a custom image you've built on a remote node, follow these steps:

Build an image with an unique name
```sh
$ docker build . -t domain/imagename:version
```
Export the image to .tar archive
```sh
$ docker save --output image.tar domain/imagename:version
```
(Optional) Compress the image - images can get quite big
```sh
$ tar -cjf image.tar.bz2 image.tar
```
Copy the file to remote node (for example via SCP)
```sh
$ scp image.tar.bz2 username@remotehost:/path/to/folder
```
On the remote node:

(Optional) Decompress the image
```sh
$ tar -xvf image.tar.bz2
```
Load the image into local repository
```sh
$ docker load --input image.tar
```
Update the service
```sh
$ docker service update --image domain/imagename:version
```

NOTE: If the service has any healthchecks, make sure they also work in the new version of the image, otherwise the service will appear as unhealthy and refuse to start. In such case you will need to remove or modify the healthcheck.

## License
A 30-day trial license of UniConfig is included, if you would like to change the license, replace the license string in file `config/uniconfig/uniconfig_license.txt` with your own.
